			<h4>PROJECT 1: <h4>
			<p>for one of the first projects in my CS162 class we created a openFrameworks project involving the simulation of randomly moving circular objects. the objects were placed at the center of the screen and had a 25% chance of moving in four different directions: up, down, left, and right. we called these "drunkard walkers" and have a 100 that are manifested in the program randomly walking there own way. <p>
